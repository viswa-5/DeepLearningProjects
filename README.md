# Projects
Small projects reimplemented from scratch.  
Includes Deep Learning, Robotics Sensing and Estimation Problems.  
1.ConvNext - ConvNeXT is a pure convolutional model (ConvNet), inspired by the design of Vision Transformers, I have used this arch for Image Classifier.  
2.FCN Image Segemenatstion -  Reimplemented Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs),a type of deep learning model primarily used for semantic segmentation.  
3.SAM-Adapter - By inserting lightweight trainable modules (CNN adapters) into SAMâ€™s (Meta Segment Anything Model) frozen backbone, SAM Adapter fine-tunes <1% of parameters, making it ideal for tasks like medical tumor segmentation or drone imagery analysis.  
4.SLAM using ICP -  The implementation of ICP-SLAM for a Lidar + IMU odometery robot.
5. VIO - SLAM -  Visual Inertial Odometry SLAM for accurate State Estimation from Camera + IMU data.
6.Orientation Tracking - Estimating orientation of a small body (camera and imu ) with rotating motion.
7.Panorama Image -  Image stitching without OpenCV.
